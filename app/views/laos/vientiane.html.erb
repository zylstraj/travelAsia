      <p>All these photos are of Luang Prabang.  Biggest mistake of our trip was going to Vientiane instead of Luang Prabang. If you want to go to Vang Vieng - Fly into Luang Prabang and go south. They built a new highway we didn't know about.</p>

      <p>Go to Luang Prabang. Check out their waterfalls, their nature, their night market. Literally anything will be better than Vientiane.</p>

      <p>Did not see any of this, but everything about this place looks incredible. If you have time - - this can be your launch off place to travel the Mehong River to Cambodia. </p>
